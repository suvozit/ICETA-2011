<h2> Art of Defense</h2>


<p>
Recent advancements in mobile processors (CPUs and GPUs) have enabled 
researchers to explore 3D augmented reality applications on handheld 
devices. Art of Defense (AoD) is a novel AR game for a commodity phone 
(the Nokia N95). The goal of Art Of Defense is to explore game design 
and interaction techniques that are well suited to mobile AR on a small 
screen device. One principle guiding AoD is to uses the phones 
limitations as part of the game itself; in this case, designing assuming
 the player has a limited view of a larger game space.

<p></p><h2> Super Quasi Black Hole </h2>
<p> This was my final project for the optimization class taught by Dr. 
Karen Liu. I wrote a LCP solver while Kane implemented a Quasi-Newton 
method. I used his solver to find 2D projectile trajectories in 
arbitrary gravitational fields defined by the user such that it would 
reach the target in a given number of steps by picking the correct angle
 and velocity. </p>

<a name="SLAR"></a>
<p> </p><h2> SLAR: An Augmented Reality interface to Second Life </h2> 

<p> This project was originally developed by Tobias Lang at Georgia 
Institute of Technology in 2007. It allows one to essentially blend real
 physical spaces with virtual places in Second Life. Brian Davidson and I
 maintained and extended this project in 2008 to handheld devices using 
streamed video. </p>

<p></p><h2> Instant Radiosity Rendering for Augmented Environments </h2> 

<p>
Along with Cristobal Alvarez, I implemented a version of Keller's 
Instant Radiosity algorithm and tested it in an augmented environment 
that is viewed using a head mounted display. This was the final project 
for CS7491: Advanced Image Synthesis under Dr. Greg Turk.

<a name="Metazoa Ludens"></a>
<p></p><h2> Metazoa Ludens </h2> 

<p> A mixed reality experience that allows you to interact remotely with
 your pet. I worked on this during the summer of 2007 before entering 
graduate school at the Mixed Reality Lab at the National University of 
Singapore under Dr. Adrian Cheok. </p>

<p></p><h2> Bomberman Mod for UT2004 </h2>

<p> The Bomberman mod is a tribute to the old Sega game by the same 
name, and tries to involve most elements of the original. The aim is to 
trap opponents by placing bombs in strategic locations on the map. 
Players gain points by wiping out opponents and destroying obstacles. 
The player with the highest score at the end of the playing time wins 
the round. Weapons include a normal bomb that detonates after a fixed 
period of time as well as a remote control that allows the player to 
place a number of bombs and detonate them all at once. The player can 
use the map to detect the positions of opponents as well as bombs. </p>

<p> I was part of a six member team and my responsibilities involved 
game design, object modeling, and scripting of general gameplay, weapons
 and network components. </p>

<p></p><h2> Wake of Destruction </h2>
<p> An arcade style game based on physics. Break and burn everything you
 can in a room before it collapses under its own weight. Developed using
 the Newton physics SDK and the C4 game engine. I was the lead 
programmer and worked with Chris Occhipinti (artwork, design) and Luis 
Cruz (video, UI). </p>
